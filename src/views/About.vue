        <p>Thanks for using my app !</p>
        <p><b-badge variant="warning">Disclaimer</b-badge> This app was <u>not</u> created in order to compete with <a href="https://twitter.com/phtevenstrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Calculator Guy</a>'s existant calculator (check his pinned tweet for free calcs !).</p>
        <p>
          It was originally created in order to learn VueJs basics, with basic queries to CoinGeckoAPI.<br />
          In the same time, i just started earning/compounding strong in order to create nodes so i tought that it could be cool to have some earnings calculator and here we are !
